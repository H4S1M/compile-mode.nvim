# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the `latest` and `main` branches will get any security issues fixed.
If you use a specific tag, I won't push any fixes for it - you're more than welcome to file an issue for any functionality you want from an old tag that no longer exists.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Vulnerabilities should be reported just like any other issue. I'll do my best to fix things in a timely fashion, but no promises.
If something is urgent you can open a pull request for it and it will likely take me less time to go over it and merge it.
